                        When Srila Sanatan Goswami met Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, he asked the following points:
                        <br>
                        oṁajñāna-timirāndhasya
                        jñānāñjana-śalākayā
                        cakṣurunmīlitaṁyena
                        tasmaiśrī-guravenamaḥ
                        <br>
                            keāmi’, ‘keneāmāyajāretāpa-traya’ ihānāhijāni — ‘kemanehitahaya’  (CC Madhya Lila 20.102)
                        <br>
                        Who am I? Why do the threefold miseries always give me trouble? If I do not know this, how can I be benefited?
                        <br>
                        There are three types of miseries which are called AdhyatmikaKlesha, AdhibhoutikKlesha, and AdhidaivikKlesha. 
                        <br>
                        Adhyatmik Klesha-  Adhyatmik Klesha refers to those miseries caused by Body and Mind. Adhibhoutik Klesha refers to those miseries inflicted by other Living entities. 
                        <br>
                        Adhidaivik Klesha-  It refers to natural disasters caused by other Demi Gods of higher planets such as extreme cold and hot weather, thunderbolts, Natural Disasters, Earthquakes, Tornadoes, Draughts etc. In this material world, there is a danger at every step. 
                        <br>
                        Further, Srila Sanatan Goswami asks to Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, “Actually I do not know how to inquire about the goal of life and the process for obtaining it. Being merciful upon me, please explain all these truths.”Afterwards, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu tells Srila Sanatan Goswami about absolute Truth
                        <br>
                        From this article, we should understand that we are taking birth in Ignorance, We are living our life in Ignorance and we are dying in ignorance only. In Kaliyuga, People are so lazy, dull-minded, misguided, unlucky, and always disturbed, that they do not know what is the ultimate benefit for them.
                        <br>
                        prāyeṇālpāyuṣaḥsabhya
                        kalāvasminyugejanāḥ
                        mandāḥsumanda-matayo
                        manda-bhāgyāhyupadrutāḥ
                        <br>
                        “O learned one, in this Iron Age of Kali men almost always have but short lives. They are quarrelsome, lazy, misguided, unlucky and, above all, always disturbed.’’
                        <br>
                        People are maddened towards worldly pleasures up to such an extent that they have forgotten that they are eternal Part and Parcel of Lord Sri Krishna. Therefore, due to the influence of Maya and Kali, they have been continuously thinking about achieving material happiness as the Ultimate Goal of Life.
                        <br>
                        nūnaṁpramattaḥkurutevikarma
                        <br>
                        yadindriya-prītayaāpṛṇoti
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        When a person considers sense gratification the aim of life, he certainly becomes mad after materialistic living and engages in all kinds of sinful activity. He does not know that due to his past misdeeds, he has already received a body which, although temporary, is the cause of his misery. The living entity should not have taken on a material body, but he has been awarded the material body for sense gratification. Therefore I think it not befitting an intelligent man to involve himself again in the activities of sense gratification by which he perpetually gets material bodies one after another. (SBG 5.5.4)

                        According to the Vedic scriptures and Srila Prabhupada, reading Srimad Bhagavatam is a vital part of a devotee%27s practice of Krishna consciousness<br>· It is the foremost of all Vedic literatures as it deals with nothing except the instructions and activities of Lord Krishna and His devotees<br>· By regularly hearing and reading Srimad Bhagavatam, one can feel tangible spiritual improvement, as it purifies the heart and gives transcendental knowledge<br>· The more one reads, the more its knowledge becomes clear, and each and every verse is transcendental<br>· The presence of Srimad Bhagavatam in any house makes that house sanctified and free from all inauspiciousness<br>Therefore, it is recommended to discuss Srimad Bhagavatam daily as much as possible, and everything will be clarified<br>Ultimately, it leads to the revelation of Lord Krishna Himself.
                        Human body is a machine and Vedas are the manual that God provides us with this machine<br>Human life if regulated according to the Vedas leads to the ultimate bliss<br>Srimad Bhagwatam, and all other religious texts that we receive directly from God or His authorized representative are the heritage of the entire human civilization<br>No single person or community has proprietorship over them<br>In this article we will read in detail about – How did Srimad Bhagwatam originate? What is the significance of Srimad Bhagavatam?
                        If the vast network of Vedic literature as explained above is considered as a tree, then the fruit of that tree is knowledge, once that fruit matures it becomes sweet<br>Srimad Bhagwatam is that matured fruit of Vedic Knowledge<br>The most secret and sophisticated topics of spiritual science are explained very sweetly in Srimad Bhagavatam<br>Srimad Bhagvatam is also known as 
                        From the point of view of spiritual life, the Srimad Bhagvatam contains sufficient information about all walks of life be it politics, family ties, magic, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, romance, friendship, mathematics, etc<br>I would like to clarify here that although Srimad Bhagvatam is a spiritual book, all the topics concerning our life are dealt with in great detail<br>The reason for such detailed logical explanations is two fold<br>On one hand they satisfy the curiosity of one’s mind and on the other hand they help us to see the Hand of God in all the activities around us.

                        At those meetings we discuss different topics and points for the development of our International Society for Krishna Consciousness<br>But there’s some of us who always feel like when we, older leaders of ISKCON come together it would be in our best interest if we would sit down together and we would just open Srila Prabhupada’s books and we would read Srila Prabhupada’s books together for two weeks straight<br>Or when we would stop reading Prabhupada’s books we just sit down and have kirtan for hours together<br>
                        And we have always felt although we know there are issues that should be resolved, naturally, we always felt that absorption in discussion of Krishna and absorption in Krishna’s Holy Name is the actual greatest solution for all problems<br>And in fact, my dear devotees, this is the point that all of us should become firmly convinced of<br>
                        We should really dedicate ourselves to the careful study of the books of Srila Prabhupada<br>Because each and every answer to whatever question we may have about the development of the science of Krishna Consciousness and ultimately the attainting of Krishna’s pure devotional service – that can be found within the books of His Divine Grace<br>
                        And then as Srila Prabhupada would always say – if a person does not have much of a tendency to read, then that person needs to absorb himself into the chanting of the Holy Names, by that alone everything will become revealed and he will attain his perfection<br>
                        It’s very important that all of our members of Krsna Consciousness movement understand his fact very-very carefully<br>
                        Many of us have heard the statement that Prabhupada once made, he said: “If I have any complaint about any of my disciples it is that they don’t study my books carefully.”<br>
                        So by this careful study of “Bhagavad Gita”, by the careful study of “Srimad Bhagavatam” and by the careful study of “Sri Caitanya Caritamrita” – all of our questions can become resolved<br>
